			<h2>PowerVR Tools and SDK v3.4</h2>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<p>In this release PVRShaderEditor adds the latest compilers for Series6, Series6 FP16, and Series6XT to provide more up-to-date profiling. PVRShaderEditor also adds new functionality to access the GLSL disassembly for these compilers, as well as full instruction set documentation. In addition, several performance optimizations have been made for the different utilities in the PowerVR Tools suite. New SDKs have been added including WebGL, Android 64bit and Linux MIPS. Furthermore, a fully redesigned PowerVR SDK Browser is now supplied with the distribution for improving accessibility of the SDK contents.</p>
			<h3>Builds</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Added support for Android arm64-v8a, x86_64 and mips64.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Examples</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>PVRScopeExample and PVRScopeRemote: updated for PVRScope changes.</li>
					<li>PVRScopeExample: CPVRScopeGraph::SetActiveGroup() now accepts a group number even if there are no counters in that group, if there are higher groups. This allows PVRScopeExample to pass an empty group, to reach a higher, populated group number. Allows for 'invalid' group numbers – i.e. SW counters.</li>
					<li>PVRScopeRemote:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Make use of PVRScopeComms new support for nested begin/ends.</li>
						<li>Utilise the CPPLProcessingScoped helper class where appropriate.</li>
						<li>Use the optional pplWaitForConnection() function.</li>
						<li>Instrumented all remaining functions in the app (LoadTextures, LoadShaders, LoadVbos), using CPPLProcessingScoped. Also made use of the __FUNCTION__ define.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>OGLES3ProceduralTextures: corrected input flags for glMemoryBarrier.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>PVRShell</h3>
				<ul>

				</ul>
			<h3>PVRShaman v2.2.2</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Incorporated new icons in the GUI.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>PVRTexTool v4.1.4</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Increased performance of ETC decompression. It’s now up to about 20% faster per surface, depending on the compression scheme.</li>
					<li>Fixed scaling issue. All test cases now work 100% correctly when downscaling.</li>
					<li>Fixed crash when saving a texture with MIP Maps to a KTX file.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Fixed bug with '-squarecanvas +' where size was being set to the largest of width and depth instead of width and height.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>PVRTexLib</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Updated PVRTC Compressor to version 1.190, which fixes the single region crash, which caused small PVRTC2 textures (or MIP Maps) to crash the tool.</li>
					<li>Fixed bug in PVRTC2 compressor where it won't properly compress textures that generate a single PVRTC region in the Y dimension (i.e. any texture, or MIP Map level in a texture, with a height of 4 or lower).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>PVRTexTool Plugins</p>
				<ul>

				</ul>
			<h3>PVRVTune v14.88</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Renamed TA to Tiler, and 3D to Renderer.</li>
					<li>Added counters:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shader proportion: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader proportion: vertex.</li>
						<li>Shader proportion: compute.</li>
						<li>Vertices per batch.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: compute.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader slot scheduled count: vertex.</li>
						<li>Shader slot size: pixel.</li>
						<li>Shader slot size: vertex.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: Tiler core.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: Renderer core.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: 2D core.</li>
						<li>GPU task time per frame: Compute core.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Complete build and custom counter groups:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Custom counters: editable fourth column.</li>
						<li>Rename the count modes "unary" and "binary".</li>
						<li>Added a filter input box for the first three columns.</li>
						<li>Set the stretch factors to give the rightmost two columns more space.</li>
						<li>Removed uniformItemSizes for the first list. That also affects width, which means the horizontal scroll bar wasn't appearing soon enough.</li>
						<li>Fixed tab order, and put the focus in the filter box by default.</li>
						<li>Now saves and restores the dialog's geometry each time.</li>
						<li>Now create counters for custom HW sources.</li>
						<li>BVNC string parsing. Should now handle V="cb" or V="3p" style BVNCs. When automatically creating per frame and per second counters for HW sources, now also creates a per clock counter.</li>
						<li>When automatically creating per frame and per second counters for HW sources, now also creates a raw counter. This lets you see the actual count in the time period. Perhaps useful in the counter table, but not in the graph.</li>
						<li>SGX XT counter: "Shader load: Compute".</li>
						<li>New counter: Batches per frame.</li>
						<li>New counter: Shader proportion: event.</li>
						<li>PVRTune regression fix: Counter Table group combo box now correctly displays the chosen group.</li>
						<li>Fixed some counter sources not being visible after choosing them in a custom group.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
				<p>PVRTuneGUI</p>
				<ul>
					<li>PID docking-window: fixed occasional disappearance of known application names (they are only received if PVRPerfServer is run with the -pid option).</li>
					<li>Monitor docking-window:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Data no longer "pauses" during periods of no GPU activity.</li>
						<li>Added the missing shader core load, for Rogue.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Counter properties docking-window:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>No longer lets the window size grow due to a long counter Name or Source string.</li>
						<li>Also sets the Name and Source strings as StatusTips (ToolTips are too distracting) - allows larger strings be read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Added support for nested user timelines. PVRTune renders these as a "flame graph".</li>
					<li>Connection screen:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>URL buttons now automatically shrink their text to fit (lost during port to Qt).</li>
						<li>"Connect To:" box now gets the focus by default, as it should, and as it used to. Can once again simply run and press Enter to go straight to the last connection.</li>
						<li>Now convert all file path slashes to '/'. This fixes/removes the possibility of two 'matching' paths in the file history but with different slashes on Windows.</li>
						<li>Status bar: now has a visual semaphore indicating connection warnings; click to show the PVRPerfServer Details dialog box.</li>
						<li>Added more feedback to PVRPerfServer details: now shows warnings at the bottom.</li>
						<li>Complete build: additional info.</li>
						<li>Fixed some rare crashes.</li>
						<li>Main window: fixed the 'empty window' behind the splash screen during first (no preferences file) start up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Changed the default docking-window layout:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Top Dock left to right: counter table (default top-most), search, remote editor.</li>
						<li>Bottom: Monitor (default top-most), Props, RS override, PID.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Mouse hover over the Monitor now causes counters to highlight. Also, in the bar chart style, empty components will now have a hit-test result.</li>
					<li>The Counter Table context menu now has a new option "Properties", which enables and brings the Counter Properties docking window foremost, and sets the focus to the Y-Axis input box.</li>
					<li>Graphs:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Graphs now scroll more smoothly even when received data is intermittent.</li>
						<li>Fixed an issue where start-up with a zoom value of one (1) would mean that the mouse-wheel could not be used to zoom out, but other methods could.</li>
						<li>Fixed vertical centering of timeline labels on Windows and Linux.</li>
						<li>Renderstate Override: sets vertical policy to preferred, rather than fixed. Makes it a much more polite docking window.</li>
						<li>Fixed a case where scrolled graph rendering could show pixel corruption (refresh would fix).</li>
					</ul>
					<li>PVRTune performance optimisations.</li>
					<li>Bug-fix: restore proper counter tool-tips.</li>
					<li>Updated PVRTuneComplete's welcome message in light of it being covered by the NDA licence, rather than the DDK source licence.</li>
					<li>No longer remember zoom or position between sessions. When loading from a file, automatically "view all" when complete.</li>
					<li>New icons.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>PVRPerfServer</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PVRPerfServer command-line:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>All non-single-character commands must now be prefixed with two dashes, e.g. --pid rather than -pid.</li>
					<li>Added new command line option quit after time (qat) e.g. "--qat=4.2" which commands PVRPerfServer to auto-quit after a time of 4.2 seconds.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>PVRPerfServer for Linux, BB10 and Android: made unnecessary and removed command line option "--disable-user-input".</li>
			</ul>
			<p>PVRScope Library</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PVRScopeComms.h:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't prefix strings with psz (thereby specifying NULL-terminated), when in fact there is a string-length parameter. pplSendMark() comment improved: the input string is not time-stamped, it's done internally.</li>
					<li>New class: CPPLProcessingScoped. Helper class which will send a processing begin/end pair around its scope. You would typically instantiate these at the top of a function or after the opening curly-brace of a new scope within a function.</li>
					<li>PVRScopeComms.h: updated comments; pplSendProcessingBegin() / pplSendProcessingEnd() pairs can now be nested.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>PVRScope: Headers should work with C code.</li>
				<li>PVRScopeReadCountersThenSetGroup(): removed nTimeUS parameter as it is now queried internally.</li>
				<li>Split PVRScopeReadCountersThenSetGroup() into two new functions: PVRScopeReadCounters() and PVRScopeSetGroup().</li>
				<li>PVRScopeStats: new function PVRScopeFindStandardCounter().</li>
				<li>Fix for per-render counters (per-frame were ok).</li>
				<li>Fixed a regression in the first SDK 3.3 release that could cause noisy data.</li>
			</ul>

					<li>Added support for 3ds max 2015 SP 2 (igame version 17.2.259.0).</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>PVRTrace v3.4</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Added data compression for trace files to reduce their size.</li>
					<li>PVRTrace will now output an error message if you attempt to load a trace file with a file format newer than the latest format recognised.</li>
					<li>PVRTrace files are no longer allowed to have ':' in their name. This caused issues when recording on Android where it is allowed and trying to pull the file on to Windows where it isn't.</li>

					<li>The call summary export now includes lists all API calls instead of just the ones used. This should make is easier to diff application runs.</li>
					<li>Fixed call highlighting on Linux.</li>
					<li>The "cancel" button has been removed from the search dialog. Now, if a search is running the "find" button becomes the "cancel" button.</li>

					<li>Added --robust that will force the use of EGL_EXT_create_context_robustness and GL_EXT_robustness and will check the reset status of the GL context after each call. If you do --robust=0 it will disable the use of those extensions.</li>
					<li>Added support for playing back eglCreateImageKHR with targets:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>EGL_GL_TEXTURE_2D_KHR</li>
						<li>EGL_GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X_KHR</li>

			<h3><strong>PowerVR Tools and SDK v3.3 Release 1</strong></h3>
			<h3>Overview</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The PowerVR Graphics SDK v3.3 includes support for the recently ratified OpenGL ES 3.1 in PVRVFrame, our desktop emulation libraries.</li>
					<li>PVRTrace now includes full recording capabilities on Android 4.4 (KiKat) and the handling of Android Native Buffers has been improved. Developers also now benefit from enhanced search and remote recording capabilities and complete support for OpenGL ES 3.0 API.</li>
					<li>PVRTune implements a new ‘monitor’ window which provides a simplified and high-level overview of CPU, memory and graphics loading, allowing developers to quickly isolate application bottlenecks. It also has improved highlight and selection capabilities and implements new per-PID stats.</li>
					<li>In addition, the SDK’s documentation has been comprehensively reviewed and updated.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Note</h3>
			Full support for the recently ratified OpenGL ES 3.1 API has been added to PVRVFrame. Please note that this support is only intended for early development, as an OpenGL ES 3.1 conformance test has not yet been released. To use it, please download the header files from the Khronos website. We will shortly release a full SDK highlighting the most important features of this new API.
			<h3>Examples</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>ToneMapping: Now it uses point sampling for its float texture.</li>
