:Title:
DisplacementMap

:ShortDescription:
This training course demonstrates displacement mapping using a texture read from the vertex shader.

:FullDescription:
Displacement mapping is an alternative to bump mapping, normal mapping, and parallax mapping, that causes the actual geometric position of points over a textured surface to be displaced, often along the local surface normal, according to the value the texture function evaluates to at each point on the surface.
