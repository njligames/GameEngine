Lighting

:ShortDescription:
A demonstration of a model being lit with 8 point lights at high performance.

:FullDescription:	
This demo shows a sphere lit by 8 differently coloured spotlights using ambient, diffuse and specular components. Ambient light is a light source of fixed intensity and colour, whilst a diffuse reflection is a reflection of light from a surface at many angles rather than just one. A specular highlight is a visual cue regarding the shape and location of an object in respect to the light source in a scene.
