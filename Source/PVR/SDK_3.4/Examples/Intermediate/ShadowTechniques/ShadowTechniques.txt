ShadowTechniques

:ShortDescription:
A demonstration of a variety of shadow techniques.

:FullDescription:	
This demo illustrates various shadow techniques, such as the dynamic blob method which draws a transparent blob under the character and the blob moves based on the centre of the object. The projected geometry method draws the object "projected" onto the floor plane, only pure black shadows are possible due to multiple polygons being projected into the same location (would give intensity differences in the shadow if transparency would be used). The final method is a projected texture where the projected shadow texture is updated dynamically each frame (generated by rendering the scene from the point of view of the light source).
