:Title:
Uniform Buffer Objects
:ShortDescription:
Shows how to use uniform buffer objects. 
:FullDescription:
This demonstration shows how to use uniform buffer objects to set the values of several shader uniforms at once. A uniform buffer object stores uniform data for a shader program, and is often used becuase switching between uniform buffer bindings is faster than swithcing several uniforms in a program.
