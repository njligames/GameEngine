:Title:
OptimizeMesh

:ShortDescription:
A demonstration of the performance gained when using optimized indexed triangle lists.

:FullDescription:	
Shows a textured model rendered in two different modes: one using a non-optimized triangle list and one using an optimized triangle list. The demo switches modes after a few seconds or after the user presses the action key. Both models were exported with the PVRGeoPOD plug-in from the SDK. The optimized triangle list case was generated using the PVRTTriStrip triangle sorting option from PVRGeoPOD.
