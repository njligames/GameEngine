:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates a shadow mapping technique.  This technique begins by determining whether a given area can be seen from the light. Each fragment that is not visible is marked in one render pass and used to create a texture. In a second render pass this texture is applied to the scene to create the shadow effect.
