:FullDescription:
Shows how to dynamically update the cube shadow map for a point light source and cast shadows using that cube shadow map. Shadow Mapping is a process by which shadows are added to 3D computer graphics by testing whether a pixel is visible from the light source, and comparing it to a z-buffer or depth image of the light source's view.
