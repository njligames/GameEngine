:Title:
3D Navigation

:ShortDescription:
A demonstration of how to implement rendering algorithms for 3D Navigation software. 

:FullDescription:	
This demo serves as an example of how to implement rendering algorithms for 3D Navigation software. Several techniques such as frustrum culling, visibility based culling and dynamic stencil-shadow volumes are employed. The demo also provides an example of how to use culling and batching to optimize rendering.
