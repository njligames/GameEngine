:FullDescription:	
The ChameleonMan demo shows a Matrix Skinned Character in combination with bump mapping. Matrix Skinning is the act of animating a vertex over time given a set (palette) of matrices and a known set of blend weights assigned to those matrices. For each frame the Matrix Palette is recomputed based on time. Per vertex, up to 3 matrices, from the palette, along with 3 weights are used by the vertex shader to update the vertex position to obtain the current animation frame position. Two lighting modes are available; per vertex lighting, and bump mapped lighting.

Controls:
	-	1	-	Toggle lighting modes
	-	Esc	-	Close the application
