:Title:
EvilSkull

:ShortDescription:
A demonstration of morphing in combination with multi-texturing. 

:FullDescription:	
Morphing creates the final object using weighted blending between a number of different configurations of the same object. Each configuration controls a certain aspect of the object. In the case of EvilSkull the different configurations represent the position of the eyebrows and cheekbones. By setting different weights it is possible to generate a huge variety of facial expressions. Meanwhile the background shows multi-texturing with two independently animated layers.
