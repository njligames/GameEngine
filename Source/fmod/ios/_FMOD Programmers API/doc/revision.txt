* Mac - Now built with SDK 10.9 (Xcode 6.0).

09/09/14 1.05.00 - Studio API minor release
----------------------------------------------------

Important:
* Studio API   - Studio::MixerStrip has been replaced by Studio::Bus and Studio::VCA.
                 The new classes do not have a release method, as their handles
                 remain valid until the bank containing them is unloaded.
* Studio API   - Studio::System::getEvent, Studio::System::getBus, Studio::System::getVCA, 
                 and Studio::System::getBank now take a string path.
                 Functions that take an ID are now named Studio::System::getEventByID, 
                 Studio::System::getBusByID, Studio::System::getVCAByID, and 
                 Studio::System::getBankByID.
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::release no longer invalidates the
                 handle immediately. The handle remains valid until the event
                 stops and is actually destroyed. In addition, this function
                 now succeeds even if the event will not stop naturally.
* Studio API   - Events with sounds triggered by parameters will now stop rather
                 than going idle when all sounds have finished and the timeline
                 cursor has reached the end.
* LowLevel API - The wide string argument of System::getDriverInfo() and
                 System::getRecordDriverInfo() has been removed. These functions
                 now return UTF-8 encoded strings.
* LowLevel API - FMOD_UNICODE flag for System::createSound() and System::createStream()
                 has been removed. These functions now accept UTF-8 encoded file names
                 to load sounds with non-ASCII characters on Windows, PS3, PS4, PS Vita, 
                 XBox One, iOS, Android, Mac, Linux, Windows Phone, and Windows Store.
* FSBank API   - FSBANK_INIT_UNICODE flag has been removed. All file name structure 
                 members and function arguments now accept UTF-8 encoded strings.

Features:
* Studio API   - Added FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_PLUGIN_CREATED and
                 FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_PLUGIN_DESTROYED callback types.
* Studio API   - Added Studio::Bank::getStringCount and Studio::Bank::getStringInfo.
* LowLevel API - Added FMOD::Debug_Initialize to configure the destination and
                 level of debug logging when using the logging version of FMOD.
                 This is a more flexible replacement for the previous
                 FMOD::Debug_SetLevel API.
* LowLevel API - Android - Added support for playing AAC files (requires Android 4.2).
* LowLevel API - Android - Reduced latency for devices that support FastMixer, see
                           "Basic Information" section of the docs CHM for details.
* LowLevel API - Added DSP::setWetDryMix so any effect can have generic wet/dry
                 signal level control.
* LowLevel API - Added 3D ChannelGroup support.  A ChannelGroup is a 'group bus' 
                 and it can now be positioned in 3d space, affecting the mix for 
                 buses and channels below it.  3D Cones, geometry etc all work.
                 Use ChannelGroup::setMode(FMOD_3D) to enable a 3D ChannelGroup.

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed transitions to the end of a loop region failing to escape
                 the loop.
* Studio API   - Fixed sends inside events occasionally having a brief period
                 of full volume when the event is started.
* LowLevel API - Fix for crash when creating multiple Systems with profiling enabled.

Notes:
* Studio API   - Transition regions no longer include the end of their range.
* Studio API   - FMOD_ERR_EVENT_WONT_STOP has been removed.
* Studio API   - Studio::EventInstance::start now resets all DSPs inside the
                 event to prevent incorrect ramping. This relies on
                 FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK leaving public parameters unchanged.
* Studio API   - Studio::System::getEvent's unimplemented mode parameter has
                 been removed, along with FMOD_STUDIO_LOADING_MODE.
* Studio API   - FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_IDLE and FMOD_STUDIO_EVENT_CALLBACK_IDLE
                 have been removed.
* Studio API   - Removed deprecated function Studio::EventInstance::createSubEvent.
* LowLevel API - Changed FMOD_FILE_ASYNCCANCEL_CALLBACK to take FMOD_ASYNCREADINFO
                 structure rather than void *handle.
* LowLevel API - The FMOD_DSP_RESET_CALLBACK documentation has been updated to
                 make it clear that it should leave public parameters unchanged.
* LowLevel API - PS4 - Thread affinity can now be set as a mask of allowed cores.
* LowLevel API - iOS / Mac - Reduced default block size to 512 for lower latency.
* LowLevel API - Android - Renamed Java interface from FMODAudioDevice to simply
                           FMOD, i.e. org.fmod.FMOD.init().
* LowLevel API - Channel::setMode moved to ChannelControl::setMode so that 
                 ChannelGroups can now also have 2D/3D mode bits set.

09/09/14 1.04.08 - Studio API patch release
----------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed crash when a second system is created but never initialized.
* Studio API   - Fixed a few ordering issues that can cause binary changes in 
                 identical banks.
* LowLevel API - Fix for pop due to unwanted volume ramping after calling
                 DSP::reset on fader DSP. This can happen when a Studio event
                 instance is stopped and then restarted. Caused by timing issue
                 with ChannelControl::setVolumeRamp.
* LowLevel API - Fix crash if FMOD_DSP_TYPE_MIXER or DSP with no read/process
                 function is passed to System::playDSP.
* LowLevel API - iOS - Fixed MP2 files being intercepted by AudioQueue causing an
                       internal error.
* LowLevel API - XboxOne - Fixed network connect not resolving host names and
                           not honoring the requested time out.
* LowLevel API - Fix rare crash if calling Channel::stop() which a non blocking 
                 Channel::setPosition is happening with a stream.
* LowLevel API - Winphone and Windows Store Apps - fixed detection of socket errors.
* LowLevel API - If a user DSP is added after the master ChannelGroup's fader that
                 changes the output channel count to something other than the 
                 software mixer's channel count, stuttering could occur.  Fixed.
* Studio API   - Windows - Fixed Studio API functions deadlocking when in
                 asynchronous mode and a sound device is removed.
* LowLevel API - PS3 - Fixed some DSP parameter sets being ignored 
                 (overwritten by SPU DMA)
* LowLevel API - Fix System::playDSP not working with custom DSP effects that 
                 use the read callback
* LowLevel API - Added Memory.Initialize function to the C# wrapper.
* LowLevel API - Fixed incorrect truncation of FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAMPLE
                 sounds created from MP3 or MP2 files (does not affect FSB).
* LowLevel API - Fixed FMOD_ACCURATETIME for FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAMPLE
                 sounds created from MP3 or MP2 files (does not affect FSB).

Notes:
* LowLevel API - The master ChannelGroup's fader/head now is not responsible for 
                 up or downmixing the signal.  It is now done beyond the dsp tree,
                 internally within FMOD.  The Master ChannelGroup's Fader can still
                 be forced to upmix if required with DSP::setChannelFormat.

20/08/14 1.04.07 - Studio API patch release
----------------------------------------------------

Fixes:
* Studio API   - Fixed an internal error when instantiating a snapshot that
                 exposes intensity as a parameter.
* LowLevel API - PS3 - Fix audio dropout/corruption when using 
                 FMOD_SPEAKERMODE_STEREO.  Usually when sidechain is involved.
* LowLevel API - iOS - Fixed System::recordStart returning FMOD_ERR_RECORD.
* LowLevel API - Fixed possible click noise on end of sound if using 
                 FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAPMLE or PCM on PS3.

                 FMOD_SYSTEM_CALLBACK_DEVICELISTCHANGED bit set, this feature
                 is disabled.
* LowLevel API - Windows - System::setOutput can be called post-init now, 
                 allowing dynamic switching between any output mode at runtime.

----------------------------------------------------

Features:
* Studio API   - Added event playback states FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_STARTING 
                 and FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_STOPPING.  
                 FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_STARTING will be returned after
                 Studio::EventInstance::start until the event
                 actually starts.  FMOD_STUDIO_PLAYBACK_STOPPING will
